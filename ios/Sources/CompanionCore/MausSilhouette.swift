// anything in `ios/App/` is unreachable by an automated test. The parser used
// to sit in `ios/App/MausAvatar.swift` with a single hardcoded path to get
// right; it now has ten generated ones, and a hand-rolled character scanner
// with that much riding on it should not be the untested part of the app.
//
// `CGPath`, not SwiftUI's `Path`, because `CompanionCore` is everything the
// phone knows that is *not* a view (see `ios/Package.swift`). `MausAvatar`
// wraps the result in `Path(cgPath)`, which is a retain, not a copy.
