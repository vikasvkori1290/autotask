// The event stream against a real URLSession.
//
// This file exists because of two bugs that shipped past every other test
// here, both in the few lines between "URLSession has bytes" and "the app
// has frames":
//
//   1. `request.timeoutInterval = .greatestFiniteMagnitude` — reads as
//      "never time out", actually produces a request that opens and then
//      delivers nothing.
//   2. Keeping only the line iterator and letting `URLSession.AsyncBytes`
//      go out of scope — AsyncBytes cancels its data task when released,
//      so the connection died after the first frame.
//   3. Reading with `bytes.lines`, which folds consecutive newlines into
//      one separator and so never reports the blank line that terminates
//      an SSE event. Zero frames, no error, connection healthy at both
//      ends.
//
// Both need a real URLSession to reproduce: the parser tests pass either
// way, because the parser was never wrong. A stub protocol that delivers
// chunks *over time* is the smallest thing that catches this class — the
// symptom of both bugs is a stream that stops early.
