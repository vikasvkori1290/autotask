import PackageDescription

// CompanionCore is everything the phone knows that is not a view: the wire
// types, the SSE parser, the API client, and the fold that maintains state.
// It is a package rather than app-target source so it can be built and
// tested with `swift test` alone — no Xcode, no simulator, no signing —
// which is also what lets the decoding tests run against fixtures captured
// from a real harness.
let package = Package(
    name: "CompanionCore",
    // macOS 13 rather than 14: the core needs nothing newer than
    // URLSession.bytes (macOS 12), and `swift test` should run on whatever
    // Mac is to hand. The app's iOS 17 floor lives in project.yml.
