 * The first-run decision seam — the port of
 * `ios/Sources/CompanionCore/Onboarding.swift`.
 *
 * It lives outside Compose for the same reason it lives outside SwiftUI: the
 * transitions that matter are the ones nobody sees until they are wrong.
 * Skipping setup must not look like a pairing, a deep link that arrived while
 * the app was closed must still open pairing, and a revoked credential must
 * never fall through to an ordinary empty state.
 *
 * What is ported here is the **timing and the routing**. The painting is
 * Material's, and deliberately not SwiftUI's.
