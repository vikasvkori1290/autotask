/**

 * fact, and every writer of it holds `gate`. These pin the two that did not.
 *
 * The window both tests use is real rather than contrived: a connection store
 * *suspends*. `DataStoreConnectionStore.save` hands the write to DataStore's
 * own IO dispatcher, so the coroutine that called it gives up the thread in the
 * middle. `Dispatchers.Main.immediate` — the scope `OpenMausApp` gives the
 * session — is precisely a dispatcher on which another coroutine then runs.

/**
 * A store whose first write suspends until the test says so.

 * the app actually runs:
 *
 * - **`save` suspends.** DataStore's `edit` moves the write to its own IO
 *   dispatcher, so the calling coroutine gives up the thread in the middle of a
 *   save. That suspension is the window these tests are about.
 * - **Cancelling the caller does not un-write the bytes.** `DataStore.updateData`
 *   hands the transform to an actor of its own and the caller merely waits for
 *   the acknowledgement; a caller that goes away leaves the write to finish. The
 *   park below is therefore [NonCancellable] — a cancellable park would model a
 *   store that rolls its write back when the caller is cancelled, which is not
 *   the store this app has, and would hide the very interleaving under test.
