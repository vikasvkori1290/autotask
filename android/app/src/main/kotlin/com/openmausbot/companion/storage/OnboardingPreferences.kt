/**
 * The three durable onboarding markers, and nothing else — the Android shape of
 * the `@AppStorage` keys `RootView` reads in `ios/App/CompanionApp.swift` and
 * the `UserDefaults` key `Session.commit` writes.
 *
 * Three properties make this the right shape rather than an incidental one:
 *
 * - **It is one instance.** `Session` writes the pending marker from a
 *   background coroutine at the moment a pairing commits; the root router reads
 *   it to decide whether the education step is due. They are the same object, so
 *   the write is visible to the reader without anybody polling, and there is no
 *   second copy of the truth to drift.
 * - **It holds booleans, in a file of its own.** Nothing here is a secret and
 *   nothing here may become one (§6): the type system offers no way to put a
 *   credential in, the file is named for this purpose alone, and
 *   `OnboardingPreferencesContractTest` fails if a fourth key ever appears.
 * - **A write is durable before it returns.** [SharedPreferences.Editor.commit]
 *   rather than `apply()`, because [com.openmausbot.companion.core.Session] puts
 *   this write *before* the connection save specifically so a process that stops
 *   in between cannot leave a restorable pairing whose marker never landed.
 *   `apply()` would hand that ordering back to a background thread and quietly
 *   undo the guarantee.
 *
 * Not backed up and not transferred, for the reason the permission bookkeeping
 * is not: these record what *this* install has already shown and spent.
