/**
 * Which of the six worlds the app is in — the port of `RootView` in
 * `ios/App/CompanionApp.swift`.
 *
 * The decision itself is not here. It is
 * [com.openmausbot.companion.core.OnboardingRouter], in `:core`, because the
 * orderings that matter are invisible until they are wrong: revocation has to
 * outrank a pending deep link, a deep link has to outrank the welcome, and a
 * pairing someone already had must never be handed first-pair education. This
 * file's job is to hand the router honest inputs and to render what it answers.
 *
 * **Nothing here asks the system for a permission.** It used to: the first frame
 * fired a batch request for notifications *and* nearby devices before the app
 * had said what it was, which made refusing both the reasonable answer. Each
 * permission now belongs to the moment it is earned — notifications to the
 * explained step after a first pairing ([NotificationOnboardingScreen]), nearby
 * devices to opening the list of computers ([PairingScreen]).
