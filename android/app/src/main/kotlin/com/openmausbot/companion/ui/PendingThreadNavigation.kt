/**
 * A notification tap, delivered to the UI exactly once.
 *
 * Two failure modes to avoid at the same time, which is why this is not simply
 * "clear the extras":
 *
 * - The Intent that launched the Activity is handed back on every recreation, so
 *   stripping nothing would re-navigate on every rotation, dragging the reader
 *   back into a task they had already left.
 * - Stripping the extras as soon as they are read loses them if the process is
 *   recreated *before* the composition consumed them — a rotation during the
 *   cold-start restore, which is exactly when a notification tap is slowest.
 *
 * So the extras stay on the Intent and what is remembered is which
 * `(botId, threadId)` pair has already been opened. That composite token rides
 * in the Activity's saved instance state (memory, not disk): it survives a
 * configuration change and is gone on a genuinely fresh launch. It holds only
 * the two opaque ids from the notification payload — never a credential or
 * device token.
