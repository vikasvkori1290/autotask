/**
 * The anchor for one linger window: an ordinary started service that exists
 * only so the process is a *service* process rather than a `cached` one while
 * the window is open.
 *
 * It hosts nothing. No second [com.openmausbot.companion.core.Session], no
 * socket, no thread, no I/O, no binder, no notification of its own. The stream
 * it protects is the one already running in this process.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** a foreground service: no `startForeground`, no
 * `foregroundServiceType`, no FGS permission. Since API 26 an app that has just
 * left the foreground keeps a grace window of several minutes in which a plain
 * background service may run, and twenty-five seconds is far inside that
 * intent. On API 34 the point is narrower still: work in a cached process is
 * blocked shortly after the transition, and a `Service` component is one of the
 * things that keeps the process out of that class.
 *
 * [START_NOT_STICKY] is load-bearing. If the process dies mid-window the socket
 * and the in-memory cursor die with it; recreating a process to finish an old
 * timer would restore neither, so there is nothing worth restarting for.
