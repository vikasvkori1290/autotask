/**
 * Reading direction comes from the words, not from the locale's layout.
 *
 * Compose's default is [TextDirection.Unspecified], and — unlike the platform's
 * own `TextView`, whose default is `TEXT_DIRECTION_FIRST_STRONG` — it resolves
 * straight off `LocalLayoutDirection`: an RTL locale gives *every* paragraph an
 * RTL base level, English or not. On an `ar-EG` device that produced three
 * measured defects, all of them the same bidi reordering:
 *
 *  - trailing punctuation jumped to the front — *"What do you mostly want help
 *    with?"* drew as *"?What do you mostly want help with"*, because a neutral
 *    `?` at the end of an LTR run inside an RTL paragraph resolves to the
 *    paragraph level and is reordered to the paragraph's leading edge;
 *  - a counted list came out backwards — the bot's *"1 2 3 … 20"* drew as
 *    *"16 15 … 1"*, because digits are weak, the spaces between them resolve to
 *    R, and the whole sequence lays out right to left;
 *  - one-line roster previews lost their opening characters — *"error: CUA
 *    Driver is not ready…"* drew as *"ror: CUA Driver…"*, the line being aligned
 *    to the right and ellipsised at what the paragraph thought was its start.
 *
 * [TextDirection.ContentOrLtr] resolves the base level from the first strong
 * character instead: English stays LTR with its punctuation in place, Arabic a
 * user types stays RTL, and text with no strong character at all — a bare
 * number, a timestamp, a path — falls back to LTR rather than to the locale.
 * That last fallback is the one place this goes past `TextView`'s
 * `FIRST_STRONG` (which falls back to the layout direction), and it is what
 * fixes the counted list.
 *
 * It is a choice about this product, not a fact about text, and it has a price:
 * a paragraph with no strong character is anchored LTR even when an Arabic user
 * typed it — Arabic-Indic digits, an emoji-only line, bare punctuation from the
 * composer. The choice is made for what this app actually carries: counts,
 * clock times, file paths, code and command output, read left to right whoever
 * is holding the phone. If the app ever ships an RTL translation, or grows text
 * where a neutral line should follow the reader rather than the content, this
 * is the line to come back to.
 *
 * This is only about the direction glyphs are *ordered* in. Where the box sits
 * is untouched: `Row`/`Column`, `padding(start=)`, `placeRelative` and the
 * auto-mirrored icons all keep reading `LocalLayoutDirection`, so the chrome,
 * the bubble sides and the table's mirrored columns still follow the locale.
 *
 * It is set on the theme's [Typography] rather than at every call site, so it
 * reaches whatever Compose draws under this theme — the message bubbles, the
 * roster previews, the labels — by way of `LocalTextStyle` and the
 * `MaterialTheme.typography` slots, with nothing new to remember at the next
 * call site.
 *
 * Its reach ends where the theme does. Notifications are drawn by SystemUI in
 * its own window, from strings that never pass through a Compose typography, so
 * the same policy has to be carried there inside the string itself — see
 * `notifications.NotificationText`, which anchors each notification paragraph
 * that would otherwise take the shade's base direction.
