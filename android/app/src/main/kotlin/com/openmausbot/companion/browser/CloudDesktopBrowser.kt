/**
 * The cloud provider's noVNC viewer, opened without teaching OpenMausMobile how
 * to speak VNC or retain the provider's session token — the port of
 * `ios/App/CloudDesktopBrowser.swift`, where the same job is done by
 * `SFSafariViewController`.
 *
 * Chrome Custom Tabs is that control's Android counterpart: a hardened browser
 * process with its own visible origin, cookie jar and WebSocket support, which
 * noVNC needs. The alternative — a `WebView` — would put the provider's session
 * inside this app's process, make us responsible for its JavaScript, storage and
 * permission prompts, and hide the origin from the person about to hand it full
 * control of a cloud machine. §20 rules out the WebView shape for the desktop UI
 * for related reasons.
 *
 * The URL is passed straight through from the join response to the browser and
 * kept nowhere: not in saved state, not in a field, not in a log. It is minted
 * per join, so the next one asks the harness again.
