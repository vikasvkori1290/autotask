/**
 * The order in which the inbound-share trampoline does its jobs, extracted so
 * the order itself can be tested.
 *
 * Incoming `ACTION_SEND` Intents carry content URIs whose read grant belongs to
 * the receiving Activity. Copying those bytes has to happen while this record
 * is still the one that holds the grant. After the copy, the original extras
 * must never reach [com.openmausbot.companion.MainActivity]: that Activity is
 * the root of the main task, so the system keeps and may persist its launching
 * Intent.
 *
 * The pairing trampoline can deliver a string after `finish()`. Share cannot:
 * the URI grant dies with this record. So: copy, relaunch, mark finishing,
 * then hand the already-local payload to process memory. The Activity stays
 * alive (no `finish()`) until the IO copy returns.
