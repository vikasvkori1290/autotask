/**
 * The API 34 side of a resolve, with the platform as two lambdas so its release
 * rules can be *observed* rather than asserted about the source.
 *
 * `registerServiceInfoCallback` is a subscription, not a question:
 * `NsdManager` documents that `onServiceUpdated` "will only be called once the
 * service is found, so may never be called if the service is never present".
 * Releasing only there — which is what the AOSP sample shows, because the sample
 * assumes the service is there — leaves a live registration behind for every
 * announced service that then goes quiet, and for every resolve still in flight
 * when the pairing screen closes. Each one is a binder registration in the system
 * server, an mDNS subscription on the network, and a strong reference to the Flow
 * that asked for it.
 *
 * So every terminal outcome releases, and [stopAll] releases whatever a closing
 * browse left behind. A registration that never happened is not released:
 * `onServiceInfoCallbackRegistrationFailed` is documented as "exactly once ... No
 * other callback will be sent in that case", and unregistering an unknown
 * listener throws on devices below T extension 22.
