 * missing on first entry (notifications, nearby devices), and the Settings row
 * asks for notifications alone. Only the second used to record that it had asked,
 * so a permanent denial through the *first* — the common path, since it fires
 * before a person ever reaches Settings — was read as "never asked" after a
 * recreation, and the Settings button then performed a request the OS silently
 * drops.
 *
 * So the launch and the flag are the same call. Nothing else in the app holds a
 * launcher, which is what makes the invariant checkable rather than a convention:
 * **if a prompt was shown, the flag is set.**
