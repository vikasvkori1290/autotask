/**
 * The message bubble, tail included — the port of `ios/App/SpeechBubble.swift`.
 *
 * The tail is not an approximation: its four Bézier segments are the ones from
 * the reference vector (`docs/ios/bubble-tail-reference.svg`), scaled so the
 * reference's cap radius becomes this bubble's corner radius. That is why it
 * curls in, drops, and ends soft rather than in a point — the shape is the
 * drawing, not a guess at it.
 *
 * The only deviation from the Swift is the untailed corner: SwiftUI's
 * `.continuous` style has no Compose equivalent, so all four corners here are
 * circular arcs. Both bubble shapes use the same arcs, so a tailed and an
 * untailed bubble in the same run still agree with each other.
