/**
 * Sequences a notification tap through resolve → navigate → consume.
 *
 * The raw [PendingThreadNavigation] target and the resolved [Chat] are two
 * layers of the same destination. Consuming the raw target before the
 * navigator records the chat leaves a window where a recreation saves
 * "consumed", loses the transient chat, and restores the roster — the tap
 * disappears. Holding the chat across a bond change leaves a window where
 * Unpaired / Unauthorized drops [PairedScreen] but the parent still opens
 * that chat against the next pairing.
 *
 * This coordinator **owns** every consume:
 * - [commit] is the only way from a resolved chat to both record the
 *   persistable stack and consume the raw target (navigate then consume).
 * - [onPending] itself performs the identified consume for the definitive
 *   no-chat case (unpaired / unauthorized / failure). Callers never choose
 *   which overload of consume to fire.
 *
 * Each resolution carries a generation so a stale callback from tap A cannot
 * consume tap B after `onNewIntent` replaced the pending target.
 *
 * RootScreen drives it; tests exercise [onPending]/[commit] directly. The
 * module has neither Robolectric nor compose-ui-test — mounting
 * [CompanionRoot] would need both plus a full [CompanionEnvironment]. Because
 * the coordinator performs the order itself, JVM tests observe
 * `navigate(A) → consume(A)` without a composition harness.
