/**
 * Where the app can be. Five places, one stack, no dependency.
 *
 * `androidx.navigation-compose` would add a library, a graph DSL and an argument
 * encoding to express roster ⇄ chat ⇄ settings ⇄ routines — CONTRIBUTING asks not
 * to add a dependency where a short module will do, and this is the short module.
 *
 * A chat is addressed by its owner rather than by a captured `Chat`: the record
 * has to be re-read from `Session.state` on every frame anyway so busy/unread
 * stay current (iOS `ChatView.current` does the same). The owner is what makes
 * the address survive: a bot keeps its id when the desktop moves it to another
 * task, and it keeps it when the task that was open is deleted — a thread does
 * not.
