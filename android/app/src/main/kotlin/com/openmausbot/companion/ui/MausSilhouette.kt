/**
 * The mascot's body, as geometry: the per-body cache that turns [MausBodies] into
 * something a canvas can fill — the port of `MausSilhouette` in
 * `ios/Sources/CompanionCore/MausSilhouette.swift`.
 *
 * This used to carry one hardcoded path, copied verbatim from the desktop. It now
 * reads ten generated ones from the catalog `scripts/gen-mascot-bodies.ts` emits,
 * which is what stops the phone's placement drifting from the desktop's: the face
 * anchor per body is solved once and written into all three renderers.
 *
 * The caching is the point. These are multi-kilobyte strings and a
 * character-at-a-time parser, and the shape each one produces never changes — but
 * a roster is hundreds of avatars, each redrawn on scroll. What is left per draw is
 * the affine fit into the rect, which is the only part that depends on where the
 * avatar is. The face the body wears is [MausFaceData]; this is only the shape it is
 * painted on.
