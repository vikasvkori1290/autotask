/**
 * When a notification tap may call [Session.openNotification], and when it must
 * wait — the Activity-side half of `ios/App/Session.swift:797-806`.
 *
 * iOS keeps a `pendingNotification` inside Session while `restorePending` (the
 * keychain still locked after launch restore). Android's Session awaits the
 * first restore attempt, but a locked or unavailable token leaves
 * `client == null` afterward and `openNotification` would show the unpaired
 * error. Holding the target in [PendingThreadNavigation] and deferring here is
 * the queue: nothing is dropped, and nothing races a restore that has not
 * produced a client yet.
 *
 * The defer signal is [Session.restoreState] — never display copy.
 * `RestoreState.Pending` covers every `TokenStore.ReadResult.Unavailable`,
 * locked or not; localising Offline messaging cannot break routing.
