/**
 * What the first run actually does, read off the mounted composition.
 *
 * The router itself is proven in `:core` by `OnboardingTest`, on pure inputs.
 * That proves the rule and nothing about whether this app obeys it: a screen
 * that ignored the marker, or fired a permission request from its first frame,
 * would leave every one of those assertions green. So these mount the real
 * `CompanionRoot` against [OnboardingScene] and ask the two questions no value
 * on any object answers —
 *
 * 1. **which screen is on the glass**, for each shape the state can take, and
 * 2. **what the app asked the system for while getting there**, in order.
 *
 * (2) is the whole reason this pass exists. The scene's `requestPermissions` and
 * the notification controller's `request` are the only ways a prompt can reach
 * the OS from this composition, and both are recorded, so "asked nothing" is a
 * measurement rather than an assumption.
