/**
 * The icon a quick reply is *chosen* with and the icon it is *drawn* with have to
 * be the same mark, or the editor is a lie: someone picks "terminal" and the
 * composer shows something else.
 *
 * That half is now the compiler's: [quickReplyGlyph] is one function, called by
 * the editor's chips and by the composer's, so there is no second table left to
 * drift — which is why this test no longer reads either file as text.
 *
 * What is left is the half no type can state: that every id
 * `QuickReply.ICON_CHOICES` offers reaches a branch of its own, instead of
 * falling quietly through to the placeholder dot.
