 * DELTA-01: who a group can be made from and in what order, pinned against

 *
 * The name is not tested here on purpose — the rule that a blank one is left out
 * of the request lives in `:core`'s `Client.createRoom`, and this screen's job is
 * to hand the field over untouched so the harness can name the room after its
 * first member.
