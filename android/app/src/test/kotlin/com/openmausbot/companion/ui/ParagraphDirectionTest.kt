/**
 * Which way a paragraph actually reads, measured off the laid-out text.
 *
 * On an `ar-EG` emulator the app drew *"?What do you mostly want help with"*,
 * counted *"16 15 … 1"* where the bot had said *"1 2 3 … 20"*, and cut the front
 * off every roster preview. All three were one defect: Compose's default
 * [androidx.compose.ui.text.style.TextDirection.Unspecified] takes the paragraph's
 * base level from `LocalLayoutDirection`, so an RTL locale reordered English.
 *
 * Nothing here asserts that a style property was set — a test like that would
 * have been green against the version that shipped the defect, since the
 * property *was* at its default and the default was the bug. Instead each test
 * mounts a composition under `LayoutDirection.Rtl` and reads the
 * [TextLayoutResult] the text node published: the resolved base direction, and
 * the x of the boxes the glyphs were actually placed in.
 *
 * The bubble tests drive [MarkdownText], which is the composable a bot reply is
 * drawn with (`MessageRow` → `MarkdownText(source = message.text)`). The roster
 * preview is drawn by a `Text` private to `ChatRow`, and `ChatRow` cannot be
 * mounted without a whole `CompanionEnvironment`, so that one is reproduced with
 * the call site's own arguments — the point being that it takes its style from
 * the theme, which is where the fix lives.

     * — which is what [MarkdownText] builds, and so what the five tests above
     * that call `layoutOf` are reading — is drawn by `TextAnnotatedStringNode`,
     * whose semantics take the measured layout out of the cache, so a direction
     * read from those nodes is the direction that was drawn. (The table test
     * below reads `Text(String)` nodes, but it never asks for a layout: it
     * compares spoken order and `boundsInRoot`, so the trap does not reach it.)
