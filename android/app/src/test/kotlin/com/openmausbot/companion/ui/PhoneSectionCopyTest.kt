/**
 * The desktop app's companion area is called **Phone**. Every instruction that
 * sends a person there has to use that name, or the first step of setup points
 * at a screen that does not exist: `ios/App/PairingView.swift:132,227`,
 * `OnboardingViews.swift:137`, `SettingsView.swift:289,302`,
 * `ComputerView.swift:89` and `Discovery.swift:137` all say Phone.
 *
 * The copy pinned here lives inside `@Composable` bodies and a private
 * `failureMessage`, so no JVM unit test can call it — a source pin, in the
 * spirit of [com.openmausbot.companion.PairingLinkManifestTest] and
 * [com.openmausbot.companion.lifecycle.SessionLingerWiringTest], is what is
 * available. It is a text assertion, not a runtime proof: it says the sentence
 * is written in the file, not that the screen renders it. The constants that
 * *are* reachable are pinned where they live —
 * [SettingsPolicyTest], [ComputerPolicyTest] and, in `:core`,
 * `FailoverTest.refusedConnectionPointsAtThePhoneSection`.
