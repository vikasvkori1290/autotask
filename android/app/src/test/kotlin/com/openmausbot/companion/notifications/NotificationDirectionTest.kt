/**
 * Which way a notification reads once SystemUI has it.
 *
 * On a moto g32 (API 33) with the system in the RTL pseudolocale, a bot answered
 * `1 2 3 … 12` and the shade drew the count backwards under a title that came
 * out right. Both strings arrived in the same server frame, so the difference
 * was not the pseudolocale: the title has a strong character and settled itself,
 * the digit run has none and took the shade's RTL base level.
 *
 * The tests that carry the argument do not assert that a marker was inserted —
 * an assertion like that would be green against any implementation that inserts
 * markers, right ones and wrong ones alike. They post through the real
 * [LocalNotificationPoster], read the string back out of the [Notification] the
 * platform built, and lay it out with the same [StaticLayout] the shade's
 * `TextView` uses, under [TextDirectionHeuristics.FIRSTSTRONG_RTL] — which is
 * what `TEXT_DIRECTION_FIRST_STRONG` resolves to in a mirrored window. What they
 * assert is the resolved paragraph direction and the x each digit was placed at.
 *
 * Not all 21 do that, though, and the difference is worth naming (the groups
 * overlap, so the counts do not add up to 21):
 *
 *  - **Direction, measured — 13.** They post and then measure the laid-out
 *    paragraph: its resolved direction, and for the counted ones the x of each
 *    digit. These are the ones the defect and the fix are argued from. Four of
 *    them also assert the string came back byte for byte unchanged.
 *  - **Came back unchanged — 5.** They post and compare strings without laying
 *    anything out: four against the input, because for an over-anchoring guard
 *    "unchanged" *is* the assertion, and one between the collapsed body and the
 *    expanded one.
 *  - **A marker written out — 2.** The blank line of a CRLF pair and the ceiling
 *    on what gets built spell an anchor into an expected value, because in both
 *    the subject is a character nobody can see.
 *  - **Reaching past the poster — 2.** `what the shade keeps is read off the API
 *    level` never posts; the per-level table has no other surface. And the first
 *    half of `a body longer than the shade keeps is anchored no further than
 *    that` calls [NotificationText.anchored] directly because it has to: the
 *    *posted* string cannot tell a bounded build from an unbounded one, since
 *    the platform truncates to the same length either way, so the only place to
 *    see where the building stopped is what was built.
 *
 * The level matters. What reaches the shade is
 * `min(5120, Notification.MAX_CHARSEQUENCE_LENGTH)` — 5120 up to API 30, 1024
 * from API 31 — so tests that cross that boundary run at both levels this
 * suite's `android-all` jars cover: 30 and 34.
